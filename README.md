Cross-Domain-iframe-Resizing
============================

To use this script the developer needs access to both domains. 

How to use
----------

This script is intended to help developers resize an iframe after an event. The developer needs access to sites 
hosted within the iframe. This can be either a sub-domain or different site. In the code example I have a 
local host with two different sub-domains. I have one main page under http://www.localhost.com that contains 4 different
iframes from http://dev.localhost.com

Script: There is only one script that should be shared across both/all domains. This is not needed but it makes 
making changes to script easier and convenient.
